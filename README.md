# Intro2ML_project
This is an optional project for graduate coursework in Introduction to Machine Learning at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. We are working on Adversarial Machine learning on MNIST dataset.

ML_Project_final.pdf contains the Report in .pdf format.

Folder media/datasets/mnist/ contains mnist database files which can be loaded using mnist_load function present in the python notebooks.

blue_team.ipynb contains code for training the network for adversarial samples. It produces results given in tables 1 and 2 in the report.

red_team.ipynb contains code for attacking the network. It produces results given in figures 1, 2 and 3 in the report.
