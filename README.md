# EL-GY 9123: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate) Project
## Team Members: Nimisha Satish Limaye (nsl278) and Monica Reddy Tirupari (mrt374)

This is an optional project for graduate coursework in Introduction to Machine Learning at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. We are working on Adversarial Machine learning on MNIST dataset.

- ML_Project_final.pdf contains the Report in .pdf format.

- Folder media/datasets/mnist/ contains mnist database files which can be loaded using mnist() function present in the python notebooks.

- Blue_Team.ipynb contains code for training the network for adversarial samples. It produces results given in tables 1 and 2 in the report.

- red_team.ipynb contains code for attacking the network. It produces results given in figure 1 and table 3 in the report.

- Optimal_Epsilon_Calculation contains code for optimal epsilon value to attack the model to achieve lower accuracy or lower confidence. Figures 2 and 3 in the report are obtained using this code.

- Citations and our contributions to the code are given in the jupyter notebook.
